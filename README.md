Varastokirjanpito

This program saves information about different products to a dictionary. This
dictionary contains key-value pairs. The keys are product ID's and the values
are objects that contain the rest of the information about the products. This
data is read by parsing a text file which is formatted according to
pre-determined rules.

The program goes through the dictionary in a loop. It uses the Product ID:s to
find appropriate values and go through the dictionaries behind them. The
program can print information about stocks (compare them,
tell their size etc.), do the same to product categories
and set products on sale. The data is processed within
the dictionary. The text file isn't used once it's been
parsed into the dictionary for processing.
